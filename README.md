## Description
This application sets up a Pokémon battle between the user and the computer. The user will initially be presented with a list of Pokémon to choose a starter from. The user will then battle a randomly generated computer Pokémon with their chosen Pokémon. The user will have to randomly generate the opponent Pokémon with a button. On battle begin, a modal pops up with a timer for the turn based battle, each Pokémon takes turns attacking until one of them hits 0HP. On win, a message appears saying you caught the defeated Pokémon and that mon is sent to your storage box. On loss, you are given a dad joke to roll your eyes at.
