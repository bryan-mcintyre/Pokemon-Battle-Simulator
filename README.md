## Description
This application sets up a Pokemon battle between the user and the computer. The user will initially be presented with a list of Pokemon to choose from. The user will then either battle the computer with their chosen Pokemon or click a button to find another Pokemon to add to their team. Once the user's selection is finalized they will battle the computer's randomly selected Pokemon. The user's win-loss stats are tracked and viewable on a modal after a battle.
